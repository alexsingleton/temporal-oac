#About
This is the repository for the [Temporal Output Area Classification](http://www.alex-singleton.com/talk/2014/07/18/temporal_OAC/) (TOAC) that was created as part of an ESRC grant looking at geodemographic change between 2001 and 2011.

* The main findings from this project can be found [here](http://www.alex-singleton.com/talk/2014/07/18/temporal_OAC/).
* A web map is viewable [here](http://public.cdrc.ac.uk/toac.php)

The code used to develop the classification and the final lookup for  2011 Output Areas and a 2001 - 2011 classification are available to download above.
