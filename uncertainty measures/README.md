#About the uncertainty measures
A full methodology paper is currently under peer review, however will be posed once available online. In addition to the TOAC classification, an uncertainty measure was developed from non-census secondary data. The idea being that change could be monitored over time.

These are available in the following two files:

* uncertainty_individual.csv - this includes each of the individual indicators (those starting with abcd_ are based on [council tax band data](http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/statisticalReleases/111103_CouncilTaxValuationListSummary.html), total_ as [population estimate change](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/pop/index.html) and freq_ as [housesale transactions](http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/market-trend-data))
* uncertainty_composite.csv - a combined indicator, created through conflation of the individual components
